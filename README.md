## Usage

### Using the Mixins

To add ownership functionality to your model:

```python
from odoo import models, fields

class YourModel(models.Model):
    _name = 'your.model'
    _inherit = ['your.model', 'tk.ownable.mixin']
    
    name = fields.Char('Name', required=True)
    # Your other fields...
```

To add assignment functionality:

```python
class YourModel(models.Model):
    _name = 'your.model'
    _inherit = ['your.model', 'tk.assignable.mixin']
    
    name = fields.Char('Name', required=True)
    # Your other fields...
```

To add access control:

```python
class YourModel(models.Model):
    _name = 'your.model'
    _inherit = ['your.model', 'tk.accessible.mixin']
    
    name = fields.Char('Name', required=True)
    # Your other fields...
```

To add responsibility management:

```python
class YourModel(models.Model):
    _name = 'your.model'
    _inherit = ['your.model', 'tk.responsible.mixin']
    
    name = fields.Char('Name', required=True)
    # Your other fields...
```

### Using Multiple Mixins

You can combine multiple mixins for comprehensive functionality:

```python
class YourModel(models.Model):
    _name = 'your.model'
    _inherit = [
        'your.model',
        'tk.ownable.mixin',
        'tk.assignable.mixin',
        'tk.accessible.mixin',
        'tk.responsible.mixin'
    ]
    
    name = fields.Char('Name', required=True)
    # Your other fields...
```

### Programmatic Usage

#### Ownership Operations

```python
# Transfer ownership
record.transfer_ownership(new_owner_id, reason="Project handover")

# Release ownership
record.release_ownership(reason="No longer needed")

# Claim ownership
record.claim_ownership(reason="Taking over this task")
```

#### Assignment Operations

```python
# Assign to user
record.assign_to_user(user_id, deadline=fields.Datetime.now() + timedelta(days=7), reason="New task assignment")

# Start assignment
record.start_assignment(reason="Beginning work")

# Complete assignment
record.complete_assignment(reason="Task finished successfully")

# Reassign
record.reassign_to_user(new_user_id, reason="Workload redistribution")
```

#### Access Control Operations

```python
# Grant user access
record.grant_access_to_user(user_id, reason="Project collaboration")

# Grant group access
record.grant_access_to_group(group_id, reason="Team access")

# Set access level
record.set_access_level('restricted', reason="Sensitive data")

# Revoke access
record.revoke_access_from_user(user_id, reason="Project ended")
```

#### Responsibility Operations

```python
# Assign responsibility
record.assign_responsibility(user_id, 'primary', reason="Project lead assignment")

# Delegate responsibility
record.delegate_responsibility(user_id, 'temporary', end_date=end_date, reason="Vacation coverage")

# Add secondary responsible
record.add_secondary_responsible(user_id, reason="Backup support")

# Transfer responsibility
record.transfer_responsibility(new_user_id, reason="Role change")
```
