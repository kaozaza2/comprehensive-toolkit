## üìö Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
# Example: Project Task model using all mixins
class ProjectTask(models.Model):
    _name = 'your.project.task'
    _inherit = [
        'tk.ownable.mixin',           # Ownership functionality
        'tk.assignable.mixin',        # Assignment functionality  
        'tk.accessible.mixin',        # Access control
        'tk.responsible.mixin'        # Responsibility management
    ]
    
    name = fields.Char('Task Name', required=True)
    description = fields.Text('Description')
```

### Ownership Management
```python
# Transfer ownership
task.transfer_ownership(new_user.id, reason="Project handover")

# Add co-owners
task.add_co_owner(user.id, reason="Collaboration needed")

# Release ownership
task.release_ownership(reason="Task completed")

# Check ownership
is_owned = task.is_owned_by_me # or task.is_owner_or_co_owner(user.id)
```

### Assignment Management
```python
# Assign to multiple users
task.assign_to_users(
    [user1.id, user2.id], 
    deadline=fields.Datetime.now() + timedelta(days=7),
    description="Complete feature implementation",
    priority='high'
)

# Change assignment status
task.assignment_status = 'in_progress'

# Check if assigned
assigned = task.is_assigned_to_me # or task.is_assigned_to_user(user.id)
```

### Access Control
```python
# Set access level
task.set_access_level(
    'restricted', 
    reason="Confidential project"
)

# Set time-based access
task.set_access_duration(
    start_date=fields.Datetime.now(),
    end_date=fields.Datetime.now() + timedelta(days=30),
    reason="Temporary access for review"
)

# Grant access to specific user
task.grant_access_to_user(
    user_id=user1.id,
    start_date=optional_start_date,
    end_date=optional_end_date,
    reason="Need review access",
)

# Create custom access group
task.create_and_assign_custom_group(
    group_name="Project Alpha Team",
    user_ids=[user1.id, user2.id, user3.id],
    group_type="custom", # project, department, temporary, custom
    reason="Project team access"
)

# Check access
has_access = task._check_user_access(user.id)
```

### Responsibility Management
```python
# Assign responsibility
task.assign_responsibility(
    [user1.id],
    description="Overall project coordination"
)

# Delegate responsibility
task.delegate_responsibility(
    user2.id, 
    end_date=fields.Datetime.now() + timedelta(days=30),
    reason="Temporary delegation during vacation"
